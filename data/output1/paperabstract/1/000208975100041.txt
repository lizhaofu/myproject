We consider the nonlinear eigenvalue problems-u ''(t) + u(t)(p) = lambda u(t),u(t) > 0, t is an element of I := (0, 1), u(0) = u(1) = 0,where p > 1 is a constant and lambda > 0 is a parameter. This equation is well known as the original logistic equation of population dynamics when p = 2. We establish the precise asymptotic formula for L-infinity-norm of the solution u lambda as lambda -> infinity when p = 2 and p = 5.
