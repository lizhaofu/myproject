A Bayesian network is a powerful tool for various analyses (e.g. inference analysis, sensitivity analysis, evidence propagation, etc.); however, it is first necessary to obtain the Bayesian network structure of a given dataset, and this, an NP-hard problem, is not an easy task. However, an enhancement approach has been followed in order to learn Bayesian network from event logs. In the present study, a genetic-algorithm-based method for generation of a Bayesian network is developed and compared with a dynamic programming method. We herein also present the useful knowledge found using our inference method.
