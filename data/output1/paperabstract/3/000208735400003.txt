Discrete event simulation is one of the most powerful tools available to the analysis of several problem domains; among them, logistic systems field. This fact interested many specialized companies to develop software, which led to different options of price and characteristics. In this context, it has been identified a growing need for a method to selecting discrete event simulation focused in logistic problems. To fill in this gap, a set of criteria that address some of the specific needs for the development of models applied to the analysis of logistic systems was proposed. These criteria formed the base of the method that has embodied the best characteristics of the works identified in the Literature. Software such as Arena, ProModel and @Risk, widely used in Polytechnic School of the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil, were evaluated for presentation of practical applicability of the proposed method.
