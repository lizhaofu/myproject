This paper concerns the formation of a coincidence set for the positive solution of an equation of the type: -epsilon Delta u = u vertical bar a(x) - u vertical bar(theta)sgn(a(x) - u), where epsilon is a positive parameter, 0 < theta < 1 and a(x) is a positive continuous function. Suppose that Delta a = 0 in an open subset Omega(0) subset of Omega. The positive solution converges to a(x) uniformly on any compact subset of Omega as epsilon -> 0. It is proved that when epsilon is sufficiently small, the solution coincides with a(x) somewhere in Omega(0) and the coincidence set converges to Omega(0) in the Hausdorff distance with the order of root epsilon as epsilon -> 0. The proof relies on the comparison principle with suitable local comparison functions.
