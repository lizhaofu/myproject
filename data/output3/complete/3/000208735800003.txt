AB Design, organisation and management of Large Logistics Networks (LLN) usually involve model-based analyses of the networks. The usefulness of such an analysis highly depends on the quality of the input data, which of course should be best possible to capture the real circumstances. In this paper, an advanced procedure model for a structured, goal- and task-oriented information and data acquisition for the model-based analyses of LLN is proposed. This procedure model differs from other approaches by focussing on information acquisition rather than solely on data acquisition, and by employing a consequent verification and validation concept. All steps of the procedure model-Goal Setting, Information Identification, Preparation of Information and Data Collection, Information and Data Collection, Data Recording, Data Structuring, Statistical Data Analysis, Data Usability Test-are described and exemplified for a network of air-freight-flow.
