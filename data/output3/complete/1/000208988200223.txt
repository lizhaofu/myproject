AB Surgical patient care is a complex organization task. On the one hand, it involves numerous specialties, e. g., radiologists, surgeons, anaesthesiologists, operation room nurses, auxiliary OR staff. On the other, it heavily relies on hospital logistics, e. g., OR scheduling, hospital warehouse management and accounting. Numerous individual computer applications assist the care team throughout the treatment process. Unfortunately, the stand-alone nature of these applications intrinsically hinders information transfer across specialities and between process steps. We have analyzed the peri-operative workflow in an orthopaedic trauma setting and identified bottle-necks in in-hospital information dissemination. We subsequently developed an integrated application to facilitate information processing along the peri-operative workflow. Our application merges innovative three-dimensional surgical planning with hospital warehouse management and logistics. Quality of patient care will increasingly depend on integrating existing medical systems to a central information turntable. It is thereby essential that such an application depicts the entire peri-operative treatment process. Process optimization through integration could likewise be applied to other surgical disciplines.
