There are two newly emerging research issues in the enterprise information systems literature. One is the scalability issue for rapidly increasing choreographic volumes between interrelated organizations. The other is the business intelligence issue for traceable and monitorable business processes and services interchanging e-Business data and applications across organizations. Based upon these emerging issues, through a functional extension of the ebXML technology we have developed a process-driven e-Business service integration (BSI) system, which is named 'e-Lollapalooza'. It consists of three major components - the Choreography Modeler coping with the process-driven collaboration issue, the Runtime & Monitoring Client for coping with the business intelligence issue and the EJB-based BSI Engine coping with the scalability issue. This paper particularly focuses on the e-Lollapalooza's development aspects for supporting the ebXML-based choreography and orchestration among the engaged organizations in a process-driven multiparty collaboration for e-Logistics and e-Commerce services. Here, it is fully deployed in an EJB-based middleware computing environment for e-Logistics process automation and B2B choreography.
