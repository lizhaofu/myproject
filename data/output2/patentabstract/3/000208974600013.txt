Using a fixed point theorem of strict-set-contraction, we establish criteria for the existence of positive periodic solutions for the periodic neutral logistic equation, with distributed delays,x'(t) = x(t)[a(t)-Sigma(n)(i=1) a(i)(t)integral(0)(-Ti) x(t+theta)d mu(i)(theta)-Sigma(m)(j=1) b(j)(t) integral(0)(-(T) over capj) x'(t+theta)d nu(j)(theta)],where the coefficients a, a(i), b(j) are continuous and periodic functions, with the same period. The values T-i, (T) over cap (j) are positive, and the functions mu(i), nu(j) are non-decreasing with integral(0)(-Ti) d mu(i) = 1 and integral(0)(-(T) over capj) d nu(j) = 1.
